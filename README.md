1. Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

2. Consider a library has received 1 million books and tomorrow is the inauguration ceremony of library. All the books are
required to be arranged alphabetically in racks before the inauguration. The task has to be completed in least possible time. Using quick sort algorithm, implement the situation.

3. Given 35 files containing stock value of each year for a particular share, arrange the values in ascending order using merge sort.

4. Consider there is an array of integers ranging from 1 to 10, and these elements are to be arranged in ascending order. Write a program to implement the situation using Counting Sort.

5. Consider John has recorded weight of 10,000 people and wants to arrange them in descending order. Write a program to implement the situation using Bucket Sort.

6. Consider a scenario where sorting in lexographic order is required. Implement the situation using Radix sort.

7. We are given N items where each item has some weight and profit associated with it. We are also given a bag with capacity W, [i.e., the bag can hold at most W weight in it]. The target is to put the items into the bag such that the sum of profits associated with them is the maximum possible. Write a program to implement 0/1 Knapsack problem.

8. Given two arrays weight[] and profit[] the weights and profit of N items, we need to put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. Write a program to implement fractional Knapsack problem.

Q9. From a given vertex in a weighted connected graph, find shortest paths to other vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm.

Q10. Given an integer array nums of unique elements, return all possible subsets (the power set). The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.

Q11. Given the dimension of a sequence of matrices in an array arr[], where the dimension of the ith matrix is (arr[i-1] * arr[i]), the task is to find the most efficient way to multiply these matrices together such that the total number of element multiplications is minimum.

12. Given two strings, S1 and S2, the task is to find the length of the Longest Common Subsequence, i.e. longest subsequence present in both of the strings. Write a program to implement Longest Common Subsequences (LCS).

13. WAP to demonstrate concept of Red Black Tree insertion and Deletion.

14. The problem is to find the shortest distances between every pair of vertices in a given edge-weighted directed graph. The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix of size n*n. Matrix[i][j] denotes the weight of the edge from i to j. If Matrix[i][j]=-1, it means there is no edge from i to j.

15. Given a text of llength N txt[0..N-1] and a pattern of length M pat[0..M-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that N > M. Demonstrate Na√Øve string matching Algorithm.
